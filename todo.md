# ColabMD Backlog (todo.md)

This is the canonical backlog file for ColabMD.

## High Priority
- [ ] Fix shared document listing so when an `.md` file/document is shared with a collaborator, it appears on their homepage under **"Shared with me"**.
  - Current behavior: collaborator can access via direct shared link, but **"Shared with me"** remains empty.
  - Expected behavior: shared docs are discoverable in dashboard list plus direct-link access.

## Existing Pending Work
- [ ] Test real-time collaboration with multiple users.
- [ ] Verify all 4 comment features work in production (Vercel).

## Nice to Have
- [ ] Improve share flow for recipients who do not yet have accounts (invite + pending access or guided signup), while preserving permission model.
